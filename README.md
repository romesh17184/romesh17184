## Hi there 👋
# Hello, I'm Romesh Rajoria 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Firmware Engineer** passionate about developing efficient and reliable embedded systems. I have a strong interest in low-level programming, real-time operating systems, and optimizing hardware-software interaction.

## 🔧 What I Do:
- Design and develop **firmware** for embedded systems
- Work with **microcontrollers** and **microprocessors**
- Debug and optimize **low-level code**
- Collaborate on **hardware-software integration**
- Experience with **RTOS**, **IoT devices**, and **communication protocols** like I2C, SPI, UART, and CAN

## 💻 Tools & Technologies:
- **Languages**: C, C++, Assembly
- **Platforms**: ARM Cortex, AVR, PIC
- **Debugging**: JTAG, GDB, OpenOCD, Trace32
- **Communication protocols**: I2C, SPI, UART, CAN
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **OS**: FreeRTOS, Linux

## 🛠️ Projects:
- **[Project 1]**: A real-time data acquisition system using ARM Cortex-M4.
- **[Project 2]**: Low-power IoT firmware for sensor-based data logging.
- **[Project 3]**: A custom bootloader for AVR microcontrollers.

## 🌱 Currently Learning:
- Advanced techniques in **RTOS** and **low-power design**
- Exploring **RISC-V** architecture and its applications
